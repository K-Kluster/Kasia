# How To Run Kasia Locally

## Getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of git downloaded - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Verify your installation by running in your terminal:
```
git version
```

If you see a version number you have installed git successfully.

## Install Rust
  <details>
  <summary>On Linux</summary>

  1. Install general prerequisites

      ```bash
      sudo apt install curl git build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config
      ```

  2. Install Protobuf (required for gRPC)

      ```bash
      sudo apt install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev #Required for gRPC
      ```
  3. Install the clang toolchain (required for RocksDB and WASM secp256k1 builds)

      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install clang-format clang-tidy \
      clang-tools clang clangd libc++-dev \
      libc++1 libc++abi-dev libc++abi1 \
      libclang-dev libclang1 liblldb-dev \
      libllvm-ocaml-dev libomp-dev libomp5 \
      lld lldb llvm-dev llvm-runtime \
      llvm python3-clang
      ```
  3. Install the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).

      If you do not have a browser but only the command line interface run:

     ```
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```

       If you already have rust installed, update it by running:
    
     ```
     rustup update
     ```

  <summary>Building on Mac OS</summary>


  1. Install Protobuf (required for gRPC)
      ```bash
      brew install protobuf
      ```
  2. Install llvm.

      The default XCode installation of `llvm` does not support WASM build targets.
To build WASM on MacOS you need to install `llvm` from homebrew (at the time of writing, the llvm version for MacOS is 16.0.1).
      ```bash
      brew install llvm
      ```

      **NOTE:** Homebrew can use different keg installation locations depending on your configuration. For example:
      - `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm` -> `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1`
      - `/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1`

      To determine the installation location you can use `brew list llvm` command and then modify the paths below accordingly:
      ```bash
      % brew list llvm
      /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1/bin/FileCheck
      /usr/local/Cellar/llvm/16.0.1/bin/UnicodeNameMappingGenerator
      ...
      ```
      If you have `/opt/homebrew/Cellar`, then you should be able to use `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm`.

      Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:
      ```bash
      export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
      export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
      export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
      ```

      Reload the `~/.zshrc` file
      ```bash
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```
  3. Install the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

     If you already have rust installed, update it by running:
     ```
     rustup update
     ```

## Install Node.js 
Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Install Kaspa WASM Files

- Download the latest `kaspa-wasm32-sdk-v1.0.0.zip` or build the [WASM precompiled binaries](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/releases) yourself.
- Extract the contents of `kaspa-wasm32-sdk/web/kaspa` into the `Kasia/wasm` directory.
